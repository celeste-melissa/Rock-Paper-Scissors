# 🪨 Rock, Paper, Scissors - Python Console Game

Welcome to my first Python project: **Rock, Paper, Scissors**!  
This game was created after completing the first four chapters of *The Legend of Python* course. It uses the core Python concepts I’ve learned so far: **variables**, **control flow**, and **user input**.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the Python script in your terminal.
2. You'll be presented with 3 options:
   - `1) ✊ Rock`
   - `2) ✋ Paper`
   - `3) ✌️ Scissors`
3. Pick your move by entering a number (1, 2, or 3).
4. The computer will randomly choose its move.
5. The winner is determined, and the result is displayed.
